### **Usage**

Once you have successfully installed **GraphFusion**, you can start exploring its functionalities. Below are some example use cases for different sectors like healthcare, education, and finance. Each example demonstrates how to initialize **GraphFusion**, process data, and interact with the platform.

#### **1. Healthcare Example**

The healthcare example demonstrates how to use **GraphFusion** for processing patient data, querying similar patients, and exporting the knowledge graph for tracking patient interactions.

##### **Code Example:**

```python
import torch
from sdk.graphfusion import GraphFusion

def healthcare_example():
    # Initialize GraphFusion for healthcare
    fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)

    # Simulate patient data (e.g., medical records, symptoms, lab results)
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Example tensor, could represent features like age, blood pressure, etc.
    
    # Context includes patient metadata like ID, age, etc.
    context = {
        'patient_id': '12345',
        'age': 45,
        'gender': 'M',
        'medical_history': ['hypertension', 'diabetes'],
        'timestamp': '2023-11-18T10:00:00'
    }

    # Process the patient data
    result = fusion.process(input_data, context)
    print("Patient Processing Result:", result)

    # Query for similar patients based on medical history
    query = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Query might represent a new patient with some medical data
    similar_patients = fusion.query(query, top_k=5)
    print("Similar Patients Based on Medical History:", similar_patients)

    # Export the knowledge graph to review tracked patient interactions
    graph_data = fusion.export_graph('json')
    print("Patient Knowledge Graph:", graph_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    healthcare_example()
```

##### **Output:**

```
Patient Processing Result: {'output': tensor([[-9.6115e-03,  3.5213e-02, -9.2055e-03, ...]], grad_fn=<SqueezeBackward1>), 'confidence': 0.5279827117919922, 'cell_id': 'cell_6645951537542080384'}
Similar Patients Based on Medical History: []
Patient Knowledge Graph: {"directed": true, "multigraph": false, "graph": {}, "nodes": [], "edges": []}
```

- **Explanation**: This output shows the result of processing patient data. The similarity query finds no similar patients based on medical history, and the exported knowledge graph is empty for this example.

#### **2. Finance Example**

The finance example demonstrates how **GraphFusion** can be used to analyze transaction data, detect potential fraud, and query similar transactions.

##### **Code Example:**

```python
import torch
from sdk.graphfusion import GraphFusion

def finance_example():
    # Initialize GraphFusion for finance
    fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)

    # Simulate transaction data
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Example tensor representing a financial transaction
    
    # Context includes transaction metadata like ID, timestamp, etc.
    context = {
        'transaction_id': 'tx12345',
        'amount': 250.75,
        'timestamp': '2023-11-18T10:30:00',
        'merchant': 'ABC Corp',
        'location': 'New York'
    }

    # Process the transaction data
    result = fusion.process(input_data, context)
    print("Transaction Processing Result:", result)

    # Query for similar transactions based on transaction metadata
    query = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Query might represent a new transaction
    similar_transactions = fusion.query(query, top_k=5)
    print("Similar Transactions (Potential Fraud):", similar_transactions)

    # Export the knowledge graph to review transaction interactions
    graph_data = fusion.export_graph('json')
    print("Transaction Knowledge Graph:", graph_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    finance_example()
```

##### **Output:**

```
Transaction Processing Result: {'output': tensor([[-9.6115e-03,  3.5213e-02, -9.2055e-03, ...]], grad_fn=<SqueezeBackward1>), 'confidence': 0.5279827117919922, 'cell_id': 'cell_6645951537542080384'}
Similar Transactions (Potential Fraud): []
Transaction Knowledge Graph: {"directed": true, "multigraph": false, "graph": {}, "nodes": [], "edges": []}
```

- **Explanation**: The result shows the processing of transaction data. It doesnâ€™t detect any similar transactions for potential fraud, and the knowledge graph is again empty in this example.

#### **3. Education Example**

The education example showcases how **GraphFusion** can be used to analyze student data, match students for peer learning, and export a knowledge graph for student interactions.

##### **Code Example:**

```python
import torch
from sdk.graphfusion import GraphFusion

def education_example():
    # Initialize GraphFusion for education
    fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)

    # Simulate student data (e.g., grades, attendance, performance metrics)
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Example tensor representing student performance data
    
    # Context includes student metadata like ID, age, etc.
    context = {
        'student_id': '98765',
        'age': 20,
        'major': 'Computer Science',
        'gpa': 3.8,
        'timestamp': '2023-11-18T11:00:00'
    }

    # Process the student data
    result = fusion.process(input_data, context)
    print("Student Processing Result:", result)

    # Query for similar students for peer learning
    query = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Query might represent a new student with some performance data
    similar_students = fusion.query(query, top_k=5)
    print("Similar Students for Peer Learning:", similar_students)

    # Export the knowledge graph to review tracked student interactions
    graph_data = fusion.export_graph('json')
    print("Student Knowledge Graph:", graph_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    education_example()
```

##### **Output:**

```
Student Processing Result: {'output': tensor([[ 0.0050, -0.0054, -0.0329, ...]], grad_fn=<SqueezeBackward1>), 'confidence': 0.5271280407905579, 'cell_id': 'cell_-5565247167439004772'}
Similar Students for Peer Learning: []
Student Knowledge Graph: {"directed": true, "multigraph": false, "graph": {}, "nodes": [], "edges": []}
```

- **Explanation**: This output shows the result of processing student data. The similarity query returns no similar students for peer learning, and the knowledge graph is empty for this case as well.

---

### **How It Works**

**GraphFusion** combines **Neural Memory Networks (NMN)** and **Knowledge Graphs (KG)** to create a unified platform for processing, storing, and querying data. By integrating these two paradigms, **GraphFusion** is able to continuously learn, make inferences, and provide insights while handling structured and unstructured data across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and education. Below is a detailed explanation of how **GraphFusion** operates.

---

#### **1. Data Input and Preprocessing**

**GraphFusion** works with two main types of data:
- **Raw Data**: This could be unstructured data such as text, numbers, or images (e.g., medical records, financial transactions, educational scores).
- **Contextual Data**: This includes metadata that provides additional details about the raw data (e.g., patient ID, timestamp, location, student ID, etc.).

When data enters the system:
1. **Preprocessing**: Raw data is preprocessed for consistency and compatibility. For example, numerical data might be normalized, and textual data might be tokenized and embedded.
2. **Contextual Enrichment**: Contextual data is combined with the raw data to provide a deeper understanding of the specific scenario. This can involve associating a patientâ€™s history with new health data or a financial transaction with details about the involved entities.

---

#### **2. Neural Memory Network (NMN) Processing**

The **Neural Memory Network** (NMN) is the core of **GraphFusionâ€™s** processing power. It operates as follows:

1. **Embedding Creation**: 
   - The raw input data is passed through an embedding layer, where it is transformed into vector representations. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the data (e.g., patient age, financial transaction amount, student performance metrics).
   
2. **Neural Network Processing**:
   - The embedded data is passed through a neural network (which could be a fully connected feed-forward network, a recurrent neural network, or other suitable architectures depending on the use case).
   - The neural network extracts higher-level patterns, performs transformations, and produces the output embeddings that encapsulate the relevant features of the input data.
   
3. **Output Generation**:
   - The processed embeddings are used for tasks such as classification, prediction, or similarity detection. For instance, in a healthcare use case, the output could be a diagnosis or treatment recommendation, while in finance, it might be fraud detection.

---

#### **3. Knowledge Graph (KG) Integration**

Alongside the NMN, **GraphFusion** uses a **Knowledge Graph** to capture and represent relationships between various entities. The **Knowledge Graph** operates as follows:

1. **Entity and Relationship Representation**:
   - The graph captures entities as **nodes** (e.g., patients, transactions, students) and relationships between them as **edges** (e.g., similar health conditions, financial relationships, academic performance correlations).
   
2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - The system continuously updates the knowledge graph with new data. As more data comes in, the system re-trains and updates the graph by adding new nodes and edges, ensuring that it accurately reflects the latest interactions and relationships.

3. **Context-Aware Linkage**:
   - The graph maintains context for each relationship. For example, if a patientâ€™s medical history changes, the relationships between the patient and previous medical conditions in the graph are updated. This contextual understanding allows for more accurate reasoning and queries.

---

#### **4. Querying the Knowledge Graph**

**GraphFusion** enables **real-time querying** of the knowledge graph to find similar entities or perform advanced inferences. Here's how querying works:

1. **Query Input**: 
   - A query is presented to the system in the form of a new data point (e.g., a new financial transaction, a new patientâ€™s health data, or a new studentâ€™s performance).
   
2. **Embedding Query**:
   - The query is passed through the same embedding layer and neural network as the initial data to generate a vector representation that captures its characteristics.
   
3. **Graph Querying**:
   - Once the query is embedded, **GraphFusion** searches the **knowledge graph** for similar nodes based on specific criteria, such as similarity in attributes, historical interactions, or other relevant relationships. For example:
     - **In healthcare**: Find similar patients based on medical history or symptoms.
     - **In finance**: Detect fraudulent transactions based on patterns from similar transactions.
     - **In education**: Recommend peer students for collaborative learning based on performance metrics.
   
4. **Result Generation**:
   - The system returns the top-k most relevant results (e.g., similar patients, fraud patterns, or peer students), along with confidence scores or any other relevant metrics.

---

#### **5. Real-time Adaptability and Continuous Learning**

One of the key advantages of **GraphFusion** is its ability to **continuously learn** and adapt in real-time. The system operates in a closed-loop, where:

1. **New Data Processing**: Each new piece of data is processed and integrated into both the NMN and the Knowledge Graph.
2. **Self-Updating Mechanisms**: As the system processes data, it updates its memory (NMN) and graph, improving its accuracy over time.
3. **Adaptation**: The model adapts based on feedback, so it can handle evolving data, such as changing financial fraud patterns, new medical conditions, or shifts in educational performance trends.

---

#### **6. Export and Visualization**

After processing the data and performing queries, **GraphFusion** allows users to **export** the processed information and insights in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, etc.). It also provides ways to visualize the **Knowledge Graph** to understand relationships and data flow.

---

#### **Summary of How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**: Raw and contextual data is collected and preprocessed.
2. **Neural Processing**: Data is embedded and processed using neural networks for deep understanding.
3. **Knowledge Graph Updates**: Relationships and entities are dynamically represented and updated in a knowledge graph.
4. **Real-time Queries**: The system allows for querying the knowledge graph to find similar entities and perform complex reasoning.
5. **Continuous Learning**: The system adapts and learns from new data over time, improving the accuracy of its outputs.
6. **Export and Visualization**: Processed results are exported and can be visualized for further analysis.

### **Model Architecture**

The architecture of **GraphFusion** is designed to provide a flexible, scalable, and context-aware memory network that integrates **neural memory networks (NMNs)** with **knowledge graphs (KGs)**. The goal is to enable continuous learning, adaptability, and the ability to process complex, structured data while maintaining high levels of semantic understanding.

Below is an overview of the core components of **GraphFusion**'s architecture:

---

#### **1. Core Components**

- **Neural Memory Networks (NMN):**  
  At the core of **GraphFusion** is a neural memory network that uses embedding-based memory management to handle large-scale, unstructured data. The NMN allows the system to continuously adapt, learn from new inputs, and store knowledge in a persistent, queryable format.

- **Knowledge Graph (KG):**  
  The knowledge graph is a structured representation of data that consists of entities and relationships. The KG tracks interactions, such as patient histories, financial transactions, or student performance. It enables the system to reason about relationships and make inferences based on the data.

- **Fusion Layer:**  
  The fusion layer acts as the interface between the NMN and the KG. It processes data input from various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education) and feeds the results into the neural memory or the knowledge graph, ensuring that the two components work together seamlessly.

---

#### **2. Data Flow and Processing**

1. **Data Input (Context + Raw Data):**
   - **Raw Data:** This can come from any domain-specific source (e.g., patient medical data, student grades, or financial transactions).
   - **Contextual Information:** Additional metadata that provides context to the data (e.g., patient ID, transaction ID, student ID, timestamp, etc.).

   The **GraphFusion** system processes both raw data and context, enabling better understanding and more meaningful interactions.

2. **Neural Processing:**
   - The input data is passed through a **neural network** (e.g., a fully connected feed-forward network or RNN, depending on the specific use case). 
   - **GraphFusion** processes the input data in the neural network, and the output represents the processed information in the form of embeddings.

3. **Knowledge Graph Updates:**
   - As the neural processing takes place, relevant information is stored in the **knowledge graph**. The relationships between entities are tracked and updated in real-time.
   - The knowledge graph is typically stored as a directed graph, where nodes represent entities (e.g., patients, transactions, students), and edges represent relationships between them (e.g., similar medical history, related financial transactions, peer students).
   
4. **Query & Inference:**
   - **GraphFusion** can query the knowledge graph to find similar data points based on specific relationships, such as finding similar patients for diagnosis, detecting fraud in transactions, or identifying peer students for collaborative learning.
   - The system uses the embedded neural representations from the NMN and the structural relationships in the KG to perform these queries and generate insights.

5. **Output & Visualization:**
   - Once data is processed and queried, **GraphFusion** can provide outputs such as the processed embeddings, confidence scores, similar entities, and the updated knowledge graph.
   - These results are exported in a variety of formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further analysis or integration into external systems.
