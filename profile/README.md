# GraphFusion AI  

Welcome to **GraphFusion AI** ‚Äì an open-source project revolutionizing the way we build, manage, and utilize Neural Memory Networks (NMNs). By combining dynamic knowledge graphs with cutting-edge machine learning, GraphFusion AI enables systems to learn, adapt, and make decisions in real-time.  

## üåü Key Features  

- **Neural Memory Networks**: Unlock dynamic, queryable memory structures for adaptive learning.  
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Harness the power of **NetworkX** for interactive, structured insights.  
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Update memory and knowledge on-the-fly as data evolves.  
- **Confidence Scoring**: Understand the reliability of stored and retrieved information.  
- **Customizable SDK**: Flexible tools to create domain-specific solutions with ease.  
- **Open Source**: Built for collaboration, research, and innovation.  

## üöÄ Why GraphFusion AI?  

GraphFusion AI bridges the gap between traditional knowledge graphs and advanced neural systems, creating opportunities across diverse industries:  

- **Healthcare**: Build patient-centric systems that adapt to changing data.  
- **Education**: Personalize learning paths through interactive memory networks.  
- **Finance**: Improve fraud detection and portfolio management with adaptive insights.  
- **Energy**: Enhance grid management with real-time, queryable knowledge.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started  

### Installation  

Install GraphFusion AI via `pip`:  

```bash  
pip install graphfusion  
```  

### Quick Start  

Create, query, and explore a Neural Memory Network in just a few lines:  

```python  
from graphfusion import NeuralMemoryNetwork  

# Create a memory network  
memory_network = NeuralMemoryNetwork()  

# Add knowledge  
memory_network.add_knowledge("What is GraphFusion AI?", "An open-source library for Neural Memory Networks.")  

# Query the network  
response = memory_network.query("What is GraphFusion AI?")  
print(response)  # Output: "An open-source library for Neural Memory Networks."  
```  

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Example Use Case  

Here‚Äôs how GraphFusion AI can transform education:  

```python  
from graphfusion.sdk import GraphFusion  

# Initialize for student data analysis  
fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)  

# Simulated student data  
student_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  

# Contextual information  
context = {  
    'student_id': 'student_123',  
    'current_grade': 'A-',  
    'course': 'Machine Learning',  
    'assignments_completed': ['HW1', 'HW2'],  
    'timestamp': '2024-11-19T15:00:00'  
}  

# Process and analyze student performance  
result = fusion.process(student_data, context)  
print("Analysis Result:", result)  

# Query for similar students for collaborative learning  
query = torch.randn(1, 64)  
similar_students = fusion.query(query, top_k=3)  
print("Similar Students:", similar_students)  

# Export a student-focused knowledge graph  
graph = fusion.export_graph('json')  
print("Knowledge Graph:", graph)  
```
