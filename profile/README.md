## Project Overview

GraphFusion is an AI-driven platform that integrates neural memory networks and knowledge graphs, providing a unified, persistent, and queryable memory system. It allows for real-time adaptability and provides context-aware recommendations in a variety of applications like healthcare, finance, education, and more.

GraphFusion combines state-of-the-art machine learning models with a flexible, dynamic knowledge graph, enabling decision-making across industries based on contextual understanding.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Learning & Adaptability**: GraphFusion supports dynamic, real-time updates to its neural memory and knowledge graph as new data is ingested.
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: It can be applied to healthcare, finance, education, and more.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Interrelates data across different dimensions (e.g., patients, transactions, students) with a persistent graph structure.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each prediction is backed by a confidence score, enabling smarter decisions.

## Usage Examples

### Healthcare Example

The following demonstrates how GraphFusion processes healthcare-related data:

```python
import torch
from sdk.graphfusion import GraphFusion

def healthcare_example():
    fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)

    # Simulate patient data
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Example tensor representing patient features
    
    # Context includes metadata (e.g., age, gender, medical history)
    context = {
        'patient_id': '12345',
        'age': 45,
        'gender': 'M',
        'medical_history': ['hypertension', 'diabetes'],
        'timestamp': '2023-11-18T10:00:00'
    }

    # Process the patient data
    result = fusion.process(input_data, context)
    print("Patient Processing Result:", result)

    # Query for similar patients
    query = torch.randn(1, 64)  # New patient query
    similar_patients = fusion.query(query, top_k=5)
    print("Similar Patients Based on Medical History:", similar_patients)

    # Export knowledge graph
    graph_data = fusion.export_graph('json')
    print("Patient Knowledge Graph:", graph_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    healthcare_example()
```

#### Sample Output:
```plaintext
Patient Processing Result: {'output': tensor([[...]]), 'confidence': 0.5271280407905579, 'cell_id': 'cell_-5565247167439004772'}
Similar Patients Based on Medical History: []
Patient Knowledge Graph: {"directed": true, "multigraph": false, "graph": {}, "nodes": [], "edges": []}
```

### Education Example

The following demonstrates how GraphFusion processes student-related data:

```python
import torch
from sdk.graphfusion import GraphFusion

def education_example():
    fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)

    # Simulate student data
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Example tensor representing student performance
    
    # Context includes metadata (e.g., age, major, grades)
    context = {
        'student_id': 'S12345',
        'age': 20,
        'major': 'Computer Science',
        'gpa': 3.8,
        'timestamp': '2023-11-18T10:00:00'
    }

    # Process student data
    result = fusion.process(input_data, context)
    print("Student Processing Result:", result)

    # Query for similar students
    query = torch.randn(1, 64)  # New student query
    similar_students = fusion.query(query, top_k=5)
    print("Similar Students for Peer Learning:", similar_students)

    # Export knowledge graph
    graph_data = fusion.export_graph('json')
    print("Student Knowledge Graph:", graph_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    education_example()
```

#### Sample Output:
```plaintext
Student Processing Result: {'output': tensor([[...]]), 'confidence': 0.7412389393310547, 'cell_id': 'cell_-5634248398109653779'}
Similar Students for Peer Learning: []
Student Knowledge Graph: {"directed": true, "multigraph": false, "graph": {}, "nodes": [], "edges": []}
```

### Finance Example

The following demonstrates how GraphFusion processes financial transaction data:

```python
import torch
from sdk.graphfusion import GraphFusion

def finance_example():
    fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=64, hidden_size=128)

    # Simulate transaction data
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 64)  # Example tensor representing financial data
    
    # Context includes metadata (e.g., account ID, transaction type)
    context = {
        'transaction_id': 'T12345',
        'account_id': 'A12345',
        'transaction_type': 'deposit',
        'amount': 1000.00,
        'timestamp': '2023-11-18T10:00:00'
    }

    # Process transaction data
    result = fusion.process(input_data, context)
    print("Transaction Processing Result:", result)

    # Query for similar transactions
    query = torch.randn(1, 64)  # New transaction query
    similar_transactions = fusion.query(query, top_k=5)
    print("Similar Transactions:", similar_transactions)

    # Export knowledge graph
    graph_data = fusion.export_graph('json')
    print("Finance Knowledge Graph:", graph_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    finance_example()
```

#### Sample Output:
```plaintext
Transaction Processing Result: {'output': tensor([[...]]), 'confidence': 0.5492913722991943, 'cell_id': 'cell_-1897345621092854413'}
Similar Transactions: []
Finance Knowledge Graph: {"directed": true, "multigraph": false, "graph": {}, "nodes": [], "edges": []}
```

## How it Works

GraphFusion integrates neural networks and knowledge graphs. It processes data through a neural memory system that adapts in real-time to new information. It can track and query data relationships via a knowledge graph, ensuring that context-aware decisions can be made across industries.

---

## Model Architecture

GraphFusion combines two major components:

1. **Neural Memory Network (NMN):** A deep learning network that processes raw data inputs, extracts meaningful features, and provides predictions.
2. **Knowledge Graph:** Stores relational data and allows querying for context-aware recommendations and insights.
