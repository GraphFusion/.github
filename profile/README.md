# GraphFusion: Dynamic Knowledge Graphs with Confidence Scoring

GraphFusion is an AI framework in development, aiming to integrate **dynamic knowledge graphs** with **confidence scoring** systems. The goal is to enhance AI's reasoning, transparency, and adaptability by dynamically building, updating, and validating knowledge during real-time interactions. This approach will improve the reliability and context understanding of AI models like large language models (LLMs) and reduce hallucinations.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **GraphFusion is currently in development**. While the core concepts have been defined, the model itself is under construction, and the codebase will be progressively updated. Stay tuned for updates!

## Vision

GraphFusion seeks to improve AI systems by providing:
- **Dynamic Knowledge Graphs** that automatically adapt to new data and interactions.
- **Confidence Scoring** for better decision-making by assigning reliability scores to knowledge nodes and relationships.
- **Explainable AI** by making reasoning more transparent to users.
- **Contextual Understanding** for more accurate, real-time responses from AI systems.

## Planned Features

- **Dynamic Knowledge Construction**: AI will continuously update its knowledge graphs as it processes data, creating a structured, adaptable knowledge base.
- **Confidence Scoring System**: Every node and edge in the knowledge graph will have a confidence score that reflects the system's certainty about the information's accuracy.
- **Query and Reasoning Engine**: Users will be able to interact with the knowledge graph through queries, receiving responses that consider both the structure and the confidence levels of the data.
- **Integration with LLMs**: Enhance the performance of large language models by integrating structured knowledge from the graphs.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Users will be able to visualize and explore the dynamic knowledge graph and see the reasoning paths taken by the AI system.

## Applications

Once completed, GraphFusion will have applications in:
- **Enhanced Virtual Assistants**: Improving the contextual understanding and reliability of AI assistants.
- **Research and Knowledge Management**: Dynamically updating knowledge for researchers and analysts in real-time.
- **Adaptive Learning Systems**: Tailoring educational content based on student interactions and knowledge gaps.
- **Intelligent Support Systems**: Providing better customer and technical support by leveraging up-to-date knowledge with confidence scores.
- **Medical Diagnostics**: Supporting doctors with dynamically updated, evidence-based knowledge in real-time.
